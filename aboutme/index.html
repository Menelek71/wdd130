                Hi everyone! Israel here... I'm really excited for this new semester and to learn with you all :D

            <p>
               I'm from Jamaica. I'm studing Applied Technology and I'm in my final year. My hobbies are chess and reading fantasy novels. Sci-fi novels are good too!

            <p>I'm currently working as a Systems Support Technician for a government agency and studying to be a Database Administrator</p>
            <p>I wish everyone best of luck in this semester and the next ones!</p>
